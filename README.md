Hello, my name is James Leibring, I have an interest in not only computer science but in
making things. I beleive that computers offre the best way to do this, and am fascinated
with the idea of creating something from nothing with only my skills in software.

I am currently learning how to deal with large sums of Data in a course known as Data Mining,
and I hope to use this knowledge to help me understand how to create conclusions from data

If ever interested in contacting me, you may reach me through
